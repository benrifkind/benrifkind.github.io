I recently completed my Ph.D at the University of Toronto. My thesis advisor was [Bálint Virág][viragWeb] and my research focused on probability theory. 

I am now trying to bridge the gap from academia to industry by teaching myself some programming; specifically I have been playing around a lot with R and python and data frames as well as learning some statistical learning theory.

I hope for this website to contain the projects I am working on in order to teach myself these things.
