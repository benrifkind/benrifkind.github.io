I recently completed my Ph.D at the University of Toronto. My thesis advisor was [Bálint Virág][viragWeb] and my research focused on probability theory.

I am now trying to bridge the gap from academia to industry by teaching myself some machine learning; specifically I have been playing around a lot with R, python, and some statistical analysis.

The (optimistic) plan is that this website will contain the projects I am working on in order to teach myself these things.
